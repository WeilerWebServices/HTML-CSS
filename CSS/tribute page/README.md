# CSS Tribute Page

A basic HTML file adapted from [FreeCodeCamp's Tribute Page project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) to be styled with CSS.

Things to practice:

- Working with background, color, font, and text properties
- Attempting basic layout with width, height, margin, padding, and text alignment
- Using different values and units
- Testing how cascade, inheritance, and specificity work
